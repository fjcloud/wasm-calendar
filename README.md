# Terminal Calendar

A retro terminal-style calendar with WebAssembly. Monthly and weekly views, event scheduling with times, localStorage persistence.

## Features

- **Monthly/Weekly Views**: Toggle between full month grid and detailed week agenda
- **Timed Events**: Schedule events with 24-hour time format
- **Auto-save**: Events persist in browser localStorage
- **Classic Terminal**: Timeless phosphor green aesthetic
- **WebAssembly**: Runs entirely in browser, no backend needed

## Quick Start

### Build

```bash
make build
```

Outputs WASM files to `docs/` directory.

### Serve

```bash
make serve
# Opens http://localhost:8080
```

Or use any static file server:
```bash
cd docs
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## Usage

- **[WEEK VIEW]** / **[MONTH VIEW]**: Toggle between views
- **< PREV / NEXT >**: Navigate months or weeks
- **TODAY**: Jump to current date
- **ADD EVENT**: Schedule events with time
- Click dates to select, events show as `[HH:MM] Description`
